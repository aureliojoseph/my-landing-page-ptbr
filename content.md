### About

- Since 2008 I've been working on Business Management, helping people improve their skills and companies achieve their goals.

- In 2011, I started a retail franchise Business where I coordinate financial and administrative areas, managing 2 stores.

- The programming world started recently as a curiosity and turned out to be an infinite universe where I see myself in. Therefore, I started to learn the path to become a Web Developer.

- My background as a Consultant and in Management has shown me that a solid Strategic Plan inspires a stronger sense of belonging for people at organizations, and this is also valid for customers' experience, directly reflecting on the performance of the company and the product. And that is why I am very interested about users interactions and how it affects their experience of products and services.

- I am currently an Associate Consultant at Miguelina Borges (link) Consultoria Empresarial, the Administrative and Financial Manager for Kidstok (link) Buriti and Cerrado, and I am freelancing as a Frontend Web Developer.
